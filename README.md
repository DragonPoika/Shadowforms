# Shadowforms

### Shadowforms is a datapack that makes all mobs at light level 0 turn into the horrible shadowforms.

Shadowforms are way more powerful than normal versions of the mobs. Shadowforms are stronger and faster, and are covered in a dark smoke, hiding them in the darkness. To counteract this, they'll get weaker when in a light level 10 or more.
This datapack also adds a new item that can be found in ancient cities, the Orb of Darkness.
